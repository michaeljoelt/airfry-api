# Airfry API 
This is a basic API setup for Heroku.
## Purpose
Quick reference for air frying temps and times.
## Status
The structure is there and works in terms of being able to reach API end points, but data needs to be updated/added and should not be used as reference at this time. 
## Future Features
Add a frontend lookup.
